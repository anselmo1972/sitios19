          <h1>First part of the proyect</h1>
          <p>
           In the first part, it went well, we did everything that had to be done, but there were some difficulties with the work for him: they were distracted. We believe that in the end, since we were no longer distracted, we worked very well and each one did everything he had to do. We hope that in the next half of the year we work as we work at the end of the first part.
We start working well and keep doing it. Hopefully
that we do not shake and finish well.

          <h1>Meet and Greet with 4th year</h1>
    <p>
The meeting room served us. In some stations it served us a lot and in others we already knew what they were telling us. In the design part we learned everything they told us because we didn't know much about it.

          <h1>Description of our logo</h1>
          <p>We made the name of the group with the initials of each one and put it in the logo. Then we put a circle of light blue color and it was created in 2019 in black print. In the middle of the circle we put a fork and a knife. Our slogan that we invent together is called “Eating differently is enjoying live”

          <h1>Meet and Greet with 4th year about Mision and Vision</h1>
          <p> In an hour of Art, a boy from each group went to the Germania Hall with the 6th-year-old boys and Melina, to listen and learn about the mission and vision of a company. That talk helped us to make a part of the project. Kolya was in charge of taking notes. He was a little distracted if he could not take the necessary notes. With everyone's help we could understand the talk and do a project activity.

          <p> In the first two hours of Tuesday we met the sixth year and they explained how to make a profit on the dishes we have. In some dishes we put seventy percent and twenty others because it was re expensive.

          <h1>Descripton of tutorial video </h1>
          <p> For the video we meet at Max's house and prepare a chocotort. We shared the costs of the ingredients and the tasks: Loren and Kolya were dipping the chocolinas in the milk, Franca and Max stirred the dulce de leche with the casancrem, Olivia (with everyone's help) was putting together the cake. When we finished, we put it to cool in the freezer. It was delicious!
